##Products, SKUs, and offers 

In CSP, partners are able to sell the following products: 

•Office 365


•Microsoft Azure 


•Microsoft Dynamics CRM


•Enterprise Mobility Suite 


For each of those products, Microsoft has created many SKUs with different sets of products and features. For a complete list of all SKUs available in CSP, see the details about the offer matrix at CSP agreements, price lists, and offers. 

Partners should also note that many product subscriptions come with additional add-ons, such as additional storage or services. These are also listed in the offer matrix. 

##Pricing

Microsoft releases updated pricing for its license-based content monthly, and pricing updates for usage-based services as they change (sometimes as often as daily). For information about finding the most recent pricing, see CSP agreements, price lists, and offers.
